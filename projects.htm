You will never be able to win. At best you will be able to draw! You can choose whether you want to play as 'X' or 'O' and theere is a scoreboard which keeps track of the wins, losses and draws. You can reset the game by pressing the reset button, and this will erase all scores and allow you to choose 'X' or 'O' again. The board will automatically clear after a few seconds...</p>
